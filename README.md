The Nerve of Steel program is a simple game where players test their patience and nerve by standing and waiting for a randomized amount of time. The objective is to sit down as late as possible without being the last one standing.

How the Game Works
Players Stand: The game starts by announcing that all players should stand.
Random Waiting Time: A random waiting duration between 10 to 25 seconds is selected and announced. This time represents the unpredictable period during which players need to decide when to sit down.
Players Sit: Players are prompted to enter their names as they decide to sit. They need to enter their name before the randomized waiting time runs out.
Time's Up: When the time runs out, the game stops accepting new entries.
Determine the Winner: The game checks which player was the last one to sit down before the time expired and declares them the winner.
Elimination: All players still standing after the time runs out are considered eliminated from the round.


How to Play?
Stand up and wait for the signal to begin.
When you feel it's the right time, sit down and enter your name.
The last player to sit wins, while those still standing are eliminated.
